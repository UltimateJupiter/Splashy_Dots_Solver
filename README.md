# Splashy_Dots_Solver
## Developed by Xingyu Zhu @ the HS affiliated to Renmin Univ. of China

*This program should be running on Python 3 with Numpy and Matplotlib installed.
*Screenshots should be added into the 'tasks' folder and mentioned in main.py
*The current version only provides coordinate sequence of the dots, and the coordinates are defined by using the row on the top as X = 0 and the column on the left as Y = 0.

Have Fun!
