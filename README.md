# Splashy_Dots_Solver
### Developed by Xingyu Zhu @ the HS affiliated to Renmin Univ. of China

This program should be running on Python 3 or Python 2.7 with Numpy, Matplotlib, tkinter and scikit-image installed. If you have a Linux computer launch config.py

Screenshots should be added into the 'tasks' folder and mentioned in main.py

Please note that screenshots made by 4.7' iPhone would be ideal for this program. Adaptation to more devices are still under development

The current version provides the movement sequence in the game using arrows in a list.


Have Fun!
