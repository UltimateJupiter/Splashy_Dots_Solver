# Splashy_Dots_Solver
## Developed by Xingyu Zhu @ the HS affiliated to Renmin Univ. of China

This program should be running on Python 3 with Numpy and Matplotlib installed.

Screenshots should be added into the 'tasks' folder and mentioned in main.py

Please note that screenshots made by 4.7' iPhone would be ideal for this program. Adaptation to more devices are still under development

The current version only provides coordinate sequence of the dots, and the coordinates are defined by using the row on the top as X = 0 and the column on the left as Y = 0.


Have Fun!
